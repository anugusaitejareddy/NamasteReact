## what is npm?

### npm is a node package manager. It is a repository for all the libraries and packages.

- It is primarily used to install and manage package and libraries
- npm allows developers to easily install, update and remove packages in their projects.
- npm provides a CLI that allows developers to run, install, update and manage scripts and dependencies
- npm hosts a vast registry of packages, where developers can share their own packages or use packages developed by others.
- With npm, developers can easily add functionality to their project and manage project dependencies

## What is parcel? Why do we need it?

### parcel is a bundler that bundles or packages our app and constructs a development build.

- Parcel is a web application bundler which simplifies the process of building and bundling. It provides a zero config bundling by automatically detecting and configuring the necessary build steps. Parcel offers a set up process for developers, so that they can focus more on writing code rather than configuring and optimizing the build process.
- Parcel features:
  1. Zero config
  2. Dev Server
  3. Hot Reloading and Hot module replacement - whenever there are changes to the source code, parcel automatically updates the source code.
  4. code splitting and lazy loading - parcel allows to split our application code into seperate bundles and load them on demand, resluting in smaller intial build sizes and faster load times.
  5. Production optimization - reduces bundle size, automatic minfication, tree shaking, image optimization
  6. Differential bundling for old browsers - It sets a `<script nomodule>` for old browsers
  7. Caching - parcel caches everything it builds to disk. On restart parcel will only rebuild the files that changed since the last time it ran.

## What is .parcel-cache?

### parcel caches everything it builds and stores it in the .parcel-cache file. This helps in reducing the build time of the application. On restart parcel will only rebuild the files that changed since the last time it ran. It won't re-parse or re-analyze everything from scratch.

## What is npx?

### npx is used to execute the packages. npx uses the npm registry if the package is not already installed. It is a CLI tool bundled with npm 5.2.0 later

## What is difference between dependencies and devDependencies?

### devDependencies: packages needed only for local development and testing. dependencies: packages that are required by our application in production.

## What is tree shaking?

### In production builds, parcel statically analyzes imports and exports and removes everything that isn't used.

## What is hot module replacement?

### By default parcel reloads whole page when we make changes to our code. But in some cases it may perform Hot module replacement where it updates the modules in the browser at run time without needing a whole page refresh

## List down 5 favourite superpowers of parcel and describe 3 of them in your own words

### dev server, caching, production optimisation, hot reloading, differential building.

1. parcel provides a dev server which helps in development of our app
2. It optimises our app for production build. By minification of files, compression, tree shaking etc
3. Lazy loading: splits our code and loads them on demand and improves the load time

### What is .gitignore? What should we add not add to this?

### The files and folders which we don't want to host on our git can be put in .gitignore file. We just need the configuration files so that we can install the dependencies through a server. We should not add the files which contains the source code of application. Any file we dont want to be tracked can be added to .gitignore

- We can ignore machine generated code which can be derived from our repository source.

## What is the difference between package.json and package-lock.json?

### package.json is a configuration file for npm and keeps track of the packages version. package-lock.json keeps track of exact version of all dependencies.

- Every project that uses NPM will have a central manifest file called package.json. It is a JSON(Javascript Object Notation) file serves as a configuration file for the project and provides information about the project metadata, dependencies, versioning, scripts and more. The file tracks which dependencies we downloaded from NPM repository.

- package-lock.json is automatically generated by npm when we install a dependency. Depedencies are specific to project they are not globally available. It gives a detailed, deterministic, platform independent record of the exact version of packages that were installed including the transitive dependencies. It guarantees reproducable builds by ensuring same versions of the packages are installed across different environments.
- package-lock.json locks the version of the packages that were installed at a specific point of time. It 'locks' all of the dependencies in a project to a specific version. It captures the dependencies and their specific versions that were installed during the initial intialisation of the project or when we explicitly update the project. It doen not automatically update with newer versions of the package. We can update the package-lock.json by modifying the package version in package.json and then run the appropriate command (npm install <dependency>).
- package-lock.json guarantes that every developer in the team will have same code in their node_modules. package.json only tracks the direct dependencies of our project but package-lock.json will track the subdependencies as well.

## Why should i not modify package-lock.json?

### Package-lock.json file stores the exact version of dependencies when the project was initialised or updated. Modifying the file leads to discrepancy between package.json and package-lock.json and when the project is installed in different environment it may not work.

- Integrity and consistency: package-lock.json automatically downloads the dependencies defined in the package.json file. It ensures exact versions of packages are installed in different environments. Manually modifying package-lock.json file can introduce inconsistencies and break the reproducability of builds.
- Modifying package-lock.json may effect the transitive dependency
- When install the dependencies by running npm install ... the package manager reads the package-lock.json to determine the exact versions of the packages to be installed. Modifying package-lock.json may conflict the package manager dependency resolution process and cause unexpected behavior.
- Version control: modifying package-lock.json can lead to conflicts in version control system when collaborating with other developers.

## What is node_modules? Is it good idea to push it git?

### node_modules can be referred to as database which consists of all dependecies that our package needs.

- node_modules folder is created when you install packages using npm. It contains all the downloaded packages and their dependencies that our project needs. When modules are installed they are stored in node_modules at the root of our application directory structure. Each module in node_module has its own directory that contains any packages it depends on.

- package.json specifies the top level dependencies our application requires so that the hosting platform can install the dependencies rather requiring node modules to be included in our deployment.

## What is the 'dist' folder?

- dist folder, short for distributable, is a directory that contains minified or concatenated version of the source code. The folder contains with minimized code without changing the functionality of code. It removes white spaces, comments and new lines which improves in load time.

## What is browserslist?

### browserslist makes our app compatible to older versions of the browser.

- browserslist is a tool that helps you specify in which browsers our application can run in. It is used by parcel to determine which browsers to target when bundling our code.

## ^caret and ~tilde

- ~version 'approximately equivalent to version'. Will update our package to all future versions without updating the minor version. ~1.2.3 will use releases from 1.2.3 to <1.3.0

- ^caret 'compatible with version'. Will update our package to all future versions without updating the major version. ^1.2.3 will use releases from 1.2.3 to <2.0.0
